# Planar data classification with one hidden layer
 **Welcome to your week 3 programming assignment. It's time to build your first neural network, which will have a hidden layer. You will see a big difference between this model and the one you implemented using logistic regression.


**Implement a 2-class classification neural network with a single hidden layer
Use units with a non-linear activation function, such as tanh
Compute the cross entropy loss
Implement forward and backward propagation
1 - Packages
Let's first import all the packages that you will need during this assignment.

**numpy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
sklearn provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.
matplotlib is a library for plotting graphs in Python.
testCases provides some test examples to assess the correctness of your functions
planar_utils provide various useful functions used in this assignment
